BERNARDO	Who's there?
BERNARDO	Long live the king!
BERNARDO	He.
BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
BERNARDO	Well, good night.
	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
	The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
BERNARDO	Say,
	What, is Horatio there?
BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
	And let us once again assail your ears,
	That are so fortified against our story
	What we have two nights seen.
BERNARDO	Last night of all,
	When yond same star that's westward from the pole
	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
	The bell then beating one,--
BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
	Is not this something more than fantasy?
	What think you on't?
BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
	That was and is the question of these wars.
BERNARDO	'Tis here!
BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
